## Quick Start

In short, this Producer worker receives incoming messages/events and puts them in a queue. You can perform any necessary actions on the message before sending it to the queue.

1.  Create a queue using the Cloudflare CLI or dashboard.
2.  Add queue bindings in `wrangler.json` and configure `index.ts`.
3.  Create a producer worker and bind it to the queue. This worker will process the received message batches.
